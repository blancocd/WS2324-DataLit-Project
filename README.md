Notebooks and details from the Data Literacy Project offered during the 2023-2024 Winter Semester at the University of TÃ¼bingen by Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig.

To get the figures included in the report you should:
1. Clean the data running in the main directory: `python datacleaning.py` 
2. Prepare the data for the regression models by running `python CLM_LVV_CDB_004_Regression.py` in the src directory</li>
3. Make the figures by running in the fig directory: `python CDB_001_Scatterplot.py && python CDB_001_Scatterplot.py`

We use the following libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib
